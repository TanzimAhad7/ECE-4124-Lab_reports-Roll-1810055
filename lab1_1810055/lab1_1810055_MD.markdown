**Theory:**

**Continuous Signal:**

Continuous refers to a variable that can take on any value within a
range or interval. In other words, the variable can be measured at any
point in time and is not limited to specific values. A common example of
a continuous variable is time.

Discrete refers to a variable that can only take on specific values
within a range or interval. In other words, the variable is limited to
certain values and cannot be measured at any point in time. A common
example of a discrete variable is the number of people in a room.
**Unit Step:**

A unit step function is a function that is zero for negative values and
one for non-negative values. It is commonly used in signal processing to
represent a sudden change in a system.

Mathematical Definition: u(t) = {0, t \< 0; 1, t \>= 0}


A unit ramp function is a function that increases linearly with time. It
is commonly used in signal processing to represent a gradual change in a
system. Mathematical Definition: r(t) = {0, t \< 0; t, t \>= 0}


A unit impulse function is a function that is zero for all values except
at t=0 where it is infinite. It is commonly used in signal processing to
represent an instantaneous change in a system. Mathematical Definition:
d(t) = {0, t! = 0; infinity, t = 0}

**Discussion:**

In this experiment, we have learned about different types of signals
such as continuous and discrete signals, and their characteristics like
unit step, unit ramp, and unit impulse. We have also learned how to plot
these signals using MATLAB. Firstly, we plotted unit step, unit ramp,
and unit impulse signals. These signals are commonly used in signal
processing to represent sudden, gradual, and instantaneous changes in a
system, respectively. We used the mathematical definitions of these
signals to plot them in MATLAB. The resulting plots showed the expected
behavior of each signal, where the unit step had a sudden change at t=0,
the unit ramp had a gradual increase, and the unit impulse had a spike
at t=0. Next, we plotted a discrete signal. Discrete signals are used to
represent data that is only available at specific points in time or
space. We used the stem function in MATLAB to plot the given discrete
signal, which showed the amplitude values at specific points in time. We
then plotted two different discrete signals and showed their addition
and subtraction. We used the logical operators and functions in MATLAB
to create the required signals and then plotted them using the stem
function. The resulting plots showed how the signals added and
subtracted from each other. Finally, we plotted two different continuous
signals. We used the logical operators and functions to create the
required signals and then plotted them using the plot function in
MATLAB. The resulting plots showed the expected behavior of each signal,
where the first signal had three different linear sections, and the
second signal had a step change followed by a ramp.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this experiment has taught us the basics of signals and
their characteristics, as well as how to plot them using MATLAB. We have
learned how to plot different types of signals such as unit step, unit
ramp, unit impulse, and discrete and continuous signals. We have also
learned how to perform simple operations on these signals such as
addition and subtraction. The practical experience gained from this
experiment will help us better understand and analyze signals in various
applications.
