**Experiment Name:** StudyAuto-Correlation and Cross-Correlation in
MATLAB

**Theory:**

Auto-correlation and cross-correlation are essential tools for analyzing
time series data in various fields, such as signal processing,
econometrics, and finance. Auto-correlation function measures how
similar a signal is to a delayed version of itself and is used to
identify repeating patterns or periodicity in the signal. It can also be
used to estimate the parameters of a time series model, such as the
order of a moving average or autoregressive process. The autocorrelation
function of a discrete-time signal x(n) is described mathematically as:

Rxx(m) = Σ \[x(n) \* x(n - m)\] ; in the autocorrelation function Rxx(m)
is a measure of the similarity between the signal x(n) and a delayed
version of itself. On the other hand, cross-correlation is useful for
measuring the similarity of two signals, even when they are not
periodic. It can be used to identify the time delay between two signals
or to detect a specific signal in noise. Cross-correlation is also used
in time delay estimation, speech recognition, and image processing,
among other applications. The cross-correlation function is defined
mathematically as follows:

Rxy(m) = Σ \[x(n) \* y(n - m)\] ; in the cross-correlation function
Rxy(m) measures the similarity of two signals x(n) and y(n) when one is
delayed by m samples. In both cases, the correlation score ranges from
-1 to 1. A positive score indicates a direct correlation between the
signals, while a negative score implies an inverse correlation. A score
of 0 means that there is no correlation between the signals. Overall,
auto-correlation and cross-correlation are powerful techniques for
analyzing time series data, providing insights into the underlying
patterns and relationships between signals. They are widely used in
various fields and are essential tools for data analysts and
researchers.

**Discussion :**

In this lab experiment, we focused on understanding the concepts of
auto-correlation and cross-correlation in time series analysis. We
started by defining what these terms mean and how they are used to
analyze signals. Auto-correlation measures the similarity between a
signal and its shifted version, while cross-correlation measures the
similarity between two distinct signals. We then performed tests using
MATLAB to demonstrate the features of these functions. We generated two
signals with known properties, such as a sine wave and a square wave,
using the sin and square functions in MATLAB. We then computed the
auto-correlation of each signal using the autocorr function and the
cross-correlation of the two signals using the xcorr function. The
output of these functions was a plot of the correlation function over a
range of lag values .By analyzing the plots, we were able to observe the
correlation patterns of the signals. In the auto-correlation plot, we
identified the periodicity of the signal, which helped us to identify
the underlying pattern of the signal. In the cross-correlation plot, we
observed the time delay between the two signals, which helped us to
identify the relationship between the two signals.

**Conclusion:**

Through this experiment, we gained practical understanding of how
auto-correlation and cross-correlation can be used in signal processing
and time series analysis. We also learned how to use MATLAB functions to
compute these correlations and analyze the results. We discussed the
theoretical properties of auto-correlation and cross-correlation and
their limitations, such as their sensitivity to noise and the
assumptions of linearity and stationarity. Overall, this lab experiment
provided us with a deeper understanding of these essential tools for
analyzing time series data.
