**Name of the Experiment:**

1.Write a code for calculating z-transform of a signal considering left and right sided by using MATLAB.<br>
2.Write a code for calculating z-transform for a non-causal signal using MATLAB.

**Theory:**

The Z-transform serves as a mathematical tool for converting
discrete-time difference equations into algebraic equations in the
Z-domain. It is applicable when an infinite series converges, indicating
that the series of values adds up to a finite result.

In the context of systems, causality pertains to whether a system\'s
output relies on future input values or solely on present and past input
values. A causal system produces output that depends only on the
input\'s current and previous values, as seen in the example y(n) =
x(n).

In contrast, a non-causal system is one where the output depends on
future input values. An illustration of this is the equation y(n-1) =
x(n), where the output at a certain point is determined by the input
value in the subsequent time step.

**Code:**

**Code for z-transform of a signal considering left and right sided:**
```
%Code for z-transform of a signal considering left and right sided
clc;
clear all;
close all;

x = [1 5 3 7 3 8 5];
l = length(x);
y = sym('z');
zt_l = 0;
zt_r = 0;

for i = 1:l
    zt_l = zt_l + x(i) * y^(-i);
end

for i = 1:l
    zt_r = zt_r + x(i) * y^(i);
end

disp('Left = ');
disp(zt_l);

disp('Right = ');
disp(zt_r);
```

**Code for z-transform for non-causal signal:**
```
%Code for z-transform for non-causal signal

x = [1 5 3 7 3 8 5];
inp = input('Enter the index: ');
l = length(x);
y = sym('z');
zt_l = 0;
zt_r = 0;

for i = 1:l
    if i >= inp
        zt_r = zt_r + x(i) * y^(inp - i);
    else
        zt_l = zt_l + x(i) * y^((-1) * (i - inp));
    end
end

output = zt_l + zt_r;
disp('Output = ');
disp(output);

**Discussion:**

The MATLAB code was utilized to carry out Z-transform calculations,
considering both left and right-sided scenarios, using a designated
signal. The length of the signal was determined through the length
function. Subsequently, a for loop was employed to iteratively process
the signal\'s elements. Within this loop, a criterion was established
for addressing the left-sided condition. Furthermore, another for loop
was applied to address the right-sided condition. Following the
conclusion of the loop, the resulting output was showcased.

Similarly, in the context of implementing the Z-transform for a
non-causal signal, a signal was chosen. The user was prompted to input
an index number. The signal\'s length was computed using the length
function. Subsequently, a for loop was employed to iterate over the
signal\'s elements. Inside the loop, an if-else structure was employed.
This structure featured conditions to account for both left and
right-sided scenarios. Following this, the computed values from both the
left and right-sided computations were summed. Ultimately, the
Z-transform\'s outcome was exhibited by displaying the calculated
result.

**Conclusion:**

The code execution was smooth without encountering any errors. This
experiment provided us with insights into concepts such as the
z-transform, causal signals, and non-causal signals.
