**Name of the Experiment:** Write a code for linear convolution and plot the signal using MATLAB.

**Theory:** In digital signal processing (DSP), convolution is a
mathematical operation used to process signals by filtering them with a system\'s impulse response. It is a fundamental operation in DSP, used in various applications such as filtering equalization, and signal analysis.Convolution involves multiplying two signals, usually the input signal and the impulse response of the system being modeled, and integrating
the resulting product over time. The resulting output signal is a
convolution of the two input signals.

Mathematically, convolution is defined as:

y\[n\] = x\[n\] \* h\[n\] = Î£k x\[k\] h\[n-k\]

where x\[n\] is the input signal, h\[n\] is the impulse response, y\[n\]
is the output signal, and k is the summation

index. Convolution in DSP can be performed using various methods,
including direct summation, fast

convolution using the FFT algorithm, and overlap-add and overlap-save
methods.onvolution is a powerful

tool in DSP because it allows us to model and analyze complex systems,and design filters to achieve desired signal

**Code:**

**Code for linear convolution:**
```
clc 
clear all 
close all 
xn = [1 2 3 4]; 
hn = [4 4 3 2]; 
 L = length(xn); 
 M = length(hn); 
 X = [xn, zeros(1,L)]; 
 H = [hn, zeros(1,M)]; 
 for n = 1 : L+M-1 
 y(n)=0; 
 for i = 1 : L 
 if(n-i+1>0) 
 y(n) = y(n)+X(i)*H(n-i+1) 
 %s (n) = H(n-i+1); 
 end 
 end 
 end 
 subplot(3,1,1)
```

**Discussion:**

The implementation of linear convolution code using MATLAB involved the declaration of two 1x4 matrices and the use of the length function to obtain the length of the matrices. A nested for loop was then used, with the first loop running from 1 to L+M-1. In the second loop, an if condition was applied, with a
formula written for the output based on this condition. After the for loop, the signal was plotted using MATLAB\'s subplot function, with the signal being discrete, the stem function was used for plotting.

**Conclusion:**

The code was executed successfully and no errors were found. Form this experiment, we had learned about linear convolution and how to plot the signal using MATALB.
