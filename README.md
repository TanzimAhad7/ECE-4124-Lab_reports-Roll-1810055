| Experiment no      | Title|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Experiment no : 1 | 1. Plot unit step, unit ramp, unit impulse signal,discrete signal using MATLAB<br>2. Plot two different discrete signal and show their addition and subtraction using MATLAB.<br>3. Plot two different continuous signal using MATALB.|
| Experiment no : 2 | Writing a code for linear convolution and plot the signal using MATLAB.        |
| Experiment no : 3| Study Auto-Correlation and Cross-Correlation in MATLAB      |
| Experiment no : 4 | 1. Take a continuous square wave signal, make a delay of that signal and do the auto correlation of the two signals. Write a code for that signal using MATLAB<br>2.Take a discrete square wave signal, make a delay of that signal and do the auto correlation of the two signals. Write a code for that signal using MATLAB.<br>3.Write a code for calculating z-transform of a signal using MATLAB.|
